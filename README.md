# Pairing session

Thanks a lot for taking your time and joining our interview process ‚òÄÔ∏è
We are excited about the opportunity to have you in our team üöÄ

At heycar we value a lot collaboration. 
As a part of our technical assessment we have a pairing session when you will have a chance to collaborate with one of our engineers you will be potentially working with at heycar. 
When the session starts you will be asked to solve a couple of quick coding tasks in the backend area with the help and guidance from our engineer.
Please checkout this project to your local machine and open it in your preferred IDE of choice (most of our engineers at heycar prefer Intelij IDEA but you can choose any). 
Make sure you can build and run the project.

# Tech Stack Choices

At heycar we are using Kotlin a lot and we are looking for engineers with either Java or Kotlin background.
We already added some basic configuration and files you will need during the session into this project however you may want to modify or add more before or during the session.

During the pairing session choose working in either Java or Kotlin - whatever language you know best. 
This project contains 2 branches - `java` and `kotlin`. 
Each branch contains a bootstrap implementation for the respective language. 
In both `java` and `kotlin` branches we added latest Spring Boot and Gradle dependencies.
Once imported, verify you can run `./gradlew build` on Linux/Mac, or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows.  
In case you are not comfortable with either of those tool feel free to change them. 

Please have the project open in the IDE and be ready to share your screen when the session starts.
If there is any problem with setting up the project please contact our recruitment team - they will bring some help.

# Thank you

We wish you to have fun during the pairing session and looking forward to talk to you soon üéâ
