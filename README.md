# Pairing session
Dear candidate, thanks for applying @ heycar.
We are eager to know how you can help us *More attractive text*

It is expected of you to *fork* this repository into your
own repository before the
scheduled session, get familiar with it, and import it to
your favourite IDE. If you use IntelliJ it will allow us to
help you better in case something comes up during the session.

We added some basic configuration of the dependencies and other files
you might need during the session, but not everything is there: you
are expected to modify some of them _during the session_.

Once imported, verify you can run `./gradlew build` on Linux/Mac,
or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows.

Please have the project open in the IDE and be ready to share your screen
when the session starts.

If there is any problem while importing the project / running the command,
please contact your recruiter as soon as possible with a helpful
description of the problem.
